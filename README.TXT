Project: lab-classes

1. getName is a method that returns the str "name" that we have entered. 

2. Calling the numberOfStudents of the class will basically return the int of the student that we have "enrolled" into said class. If we simply create a student without calling the action enrollStudent(), then said student won't show up
when we call the numberOfStudents

3. Inspecting the LabClass object reveals that it has no fields

4. 0 is an int
"hello" is a String
101 - 1 is a int (since any calculations result in an int)
true is a boolean
"33" is a String because it's surrounded by quotes
3.1415 should be a double, though I'm not sure

5. To add a fields, I think you would need to first say that there is a field, and it has a piece of data called something, and then decide how it gets its value.

6. I don't think so, I remember from a video tutorial that I've watched that an object can only be created from a single class
